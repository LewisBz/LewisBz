🤝 Collaboration & Communication

I strongly value clear and assertive communication as part of good engineering.
I enjoy working in team-oriented environments, sharing ideas, giving and
receiving feedback, and aligning technical decisions with real objectives.

Good systems are built with good code —
great systems are built with good teams.

🧭 Engineering Values

Clear communication over assumptions

Teamwork over ego

Simplicity over unnecessary complexity

AI as a tool, not a shortcut
